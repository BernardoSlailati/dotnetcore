~ The dotnet ef tool is no longer part of the .NET Core SDK ~

   This change allows us to ship "dotnet ef" as a regular .NET CLI tool that can be installed as either
   a global or local tool. For example, to be able to manage migrations or scaffold a DbContext, install
   dotnet ef as a global tool typing the following command: dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef

   Obs: Cannot find command 'dotnet ef'? => In bash or zsh: export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.dotnet/tools/"
